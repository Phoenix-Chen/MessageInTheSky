### Setup & Installation

### Note
***
1. We used play framework 2.4 instead of 2.5 due to compatibility issue with one netty library that required by Google NLP API.
2. Ran into several problems when deploy the application onto server. Eventually used [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) to run the application in virtual terminal.
